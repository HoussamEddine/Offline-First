      <h3>WHAT IS A PROGRESSIVE WEB APP</h3>
      <p>
        A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a web app that uses modern web capabilities to deliver an app-like experience to users. These
        apps meet certain requirements (see below), are deployed to servers, accessible through URLs, and indexed by search
        engines. This can work in conjunction with Cordova to provide a multiple deploy targets for all your users. You can
        deploy your app as a PWA as well as Native app and take advantage of both channels. Ionic allows you to ship your
        app to not only the app store, but also deploy to the mobile web as a PWA. What is required To be considered a Progressive
        Web App, your app must be:
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Progressive - Work for every user, regardless of browser choice, because they are built with progressive enhancement
              as a core tenet.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Responsive - Fit any form factor, desktop, mobile, tablet, or whatever is next.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Connectivity independent - Enhanced with service workers to work offline or on low quality networks.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>App-like - Use the app-shell model to provide app-style navigation and interactions.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Fresh - Always up-to-date thanks to the service worker update process.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Safe - Served via HTTPS to prevent snooping and ensure content has not been tampered with.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Discoverable - Are identifiable as “applications” thanks to W3C manifests and service worker registration scope
              allowing search engines to find them.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Re-engageable - Make re-engagement easy through features like push notifications.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Installable - Allow users to “keep” apps they find most useful on their home screen without the hassle of an
              app store.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Linkable - Easily share via URL and not require complex installation.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <br> There is a lot here, but it boils down to a few points for Ionic apps. Offline Support Apps should be able to work
        offline. Whether that be displaying a proper “offline” message or caching app data for display purpose.
        <br>
        <br>
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest">Web App Manifest</a>
        <br>
        <br> An app manifest file should describe the resources your app will need. This includes your app’s displayed name,
        icons, as well as splash screen. If you link to the manifest file in your index.html, browsers will detect that and
        load the resources for you. Service Worker Service worker could be mentioned in Offline Support, but it really deserves
        its own section.

        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API">Service worker</a>
        <br>
        <br> provides a programmatic way to cache app resources. Be it JavaScript files or JSON data from a HTTP request. The
        programmatic API allows developers to decide how to handle caching and provides a much more flexible experience than
        other options.
